# PR2A03-7-
A clock-accurate FPGA clone of the NES/Famicom 2A03(7) APU (pAPU), created on the basis of reverse engineering.
All information about the internal structure can be found here: https://github.com/emu-russia/breaks/tree/master/BreakingNESWiki/APU

This core is multi-regional, switching between NTSC and PAL regions is available, with changes in the corresponding operating timings.
All PLAs are packaged in m4k (m9k) blocks with mif initialization files.
